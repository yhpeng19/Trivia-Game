Place to comment on issues or observations with the project so far.
    
    - SpringBoot_Project is a project that uses dependency injections and using 
      GET, POST, DELETE on Postman to show how interaction between the front end 
      Android application and the backend spring boot.
      
    - Spring-Boot-mysql1 is a project that uses jdbc and jpa to connect to the
      mysql database. It worked on my local machine, but I did have issues 
      connecting with the one given to us.
      
      I split the learning into 2 classes as when I tried to work on connecting
      the request portion with the sql portion, I ran into issues codewise and
      visualizing what was happening.
      
      Fixed Git issue. Global key issue.
